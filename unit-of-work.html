<h3 id="DocCommonApproaches">Common connection &amp; transaction management approaches</h3>
<p>Connection and transaction management is one of the most important concepts 
in an application that uses a database. When to open a connection, when to 
start a transaction, how to dispose the connection and so on.. </p>
<p>As probably you know, .NET uses connection pooling. So, creating a connection 
actually gets a connection from the pool since creating a new connection has a 
cost. If there is no free connection in the pool, a new one is 
created and added to the pool. When you dispose the connection, it's actually 
sent back to the pool. It's not disposed completely. This mechanism provided by 
.NET as an out of the box feature. So, we should always dispose a connection 
after using it and create a new connection when needed. This is the best 
practice.</p>
<p>There are two common approach to create/dispose a database connection in an 
application:</p>
<p><strong>First approach</strong>: Creating a connection when a web request begins (Application_BeginRequest 
event in global.asax), using the same connection in all database operations and 
closing/disposing the connection at end of the request (Application_EndRequest event). 
This is simple but not efficient. Why?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Maybe there is no database operation in a request, but a connection is 
	opened anyway. An inefficient usage of the connection pool.</li>
	<li>There maybe cases a request is very long and database operation takes a short time in that request. 
	This is also an inefficient way of using connection pool.</li>
	<li>This is possbile only in a web application. If your application is a 
	Windows service, this can not be implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it's considered as a best practice to perform database operations in a
<strong>transactional</strong> way. If one operation fails, all of them are 
rolled back. Since a transaction may lock some rows (even tables) in database, 
it must be short-lived.</p>
<p><strong>Second approach</strong>: Creating a connection when needed (just 
before using it) and disposing it just after using it. This is the most 
efficient but a tedious and repating work to create/dispose connections 
everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="DocAbpApproach">Connection &amp; Transaction management in ASP.NET Boilerplate</h3>

<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate mixes both approach and provides a simple yet efficient model.</p>
<h4 id="DocRepositoryClasses">Repository classes</h4>
<p><a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">Repositories</a> are main classes 
where database operations are performed. ASP.NET Boilerplate <strong>opens
</strong>a database connection (it may not be opened immediately, but opened in 
first database usage, based on ORM provider implementation) and begins a <strong>transaction </strong>when
<strong>entering </strong>a repository method. So, you can use connection safely 
in a repository method. At the end of the method, the transaction is <strong>
commited</strong> and the connection is <strong>disposed</strong>. If the 
repository method throws any <strong>exception</strong>, transaction is <strong>
rolled back</strong> and the connection is disposed. In this way, a repository 
method is <strong>atomic</strong> (a <strong>unit of work</strong>). ASP.NET Boilerplate does 
all of these automatically. Here, a sample repository:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class ContentRepository : NhRepositoryBase&lt;Content&gt;, IContentRepository
{
    public List&lt;Content&gt; GetActiveContents(string searchCondition)
    {
        var query = from content in Session.Query&lt;Content&gt;()
                    where content.IsActive &amp;&amp; !content.IsDeleted
                    select content;

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(searchCondition))
        {
            query = query.Where(content =&gt; content.Text.Contains(searchCondition));
        }

        return query.ToList();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This sample uses NHibernate as ORM. As shown above, no database connection 
(Session in NHibernate) open/close code is written.</p>
<p>If a repository method calls another repository method (in general, if a unit 
of work method calls another unit of work method), both uses same 
connection &amp; transaction. The first entering method manages connection &amp; 
transaction, others use it.</p>
<h4 id="DocAppServices">Application services</h4>
<p>An <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">application service</a> 
method is also considered a unit of work. Assume that we have an <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">
application service</a> method like below:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class PersonAppService : IPersonAppService
{
    private readonly IPersonRepository _personRepository;
    private readonly IStatisticsRepository _statisticsRepository;

    public PersonAppService(IPersonRepository personRepository, IStatisticsRepository statisticsRepository)
    {
        _personRepository = personRepository;
        _statisticsRepository = statisticsRepository;
    }

    public void CreatePerson(CreatePersonInput input)
    {
        var person = new Person { Name = input.Name, EmailAddress = input.EmailAddress };
        _personRepository.Insert(person);
        _statisticsRepository.IncrementPeopleCount();
    }
}</pre>

<p>In the CreatePerson method, we're inserting a person using person repository 
and incrementing total people count using statistics repository. Both of 
repositories <strong>shares </strong>same connection and transaction in this 
example since this is an application service method. ASP.NET Boilerplate opens a 
database connection and starts a transaction when entering CreatePerson method 
and commint the transaction at end of the method if no exception is thrown, 
rolls back if any exception occurs. In that way, all database operations in 
CreatePerson method becomes <strong>atomic</strong> (<strong>unit of work</strong>).</p>
<h4 id="DocUow">Unit Of Work</h4>
<p>Unit of work <strong>implicitly</strong> works for repository and application service methods. 
You should <strong>explicitly </strong>use it if you want to control database connection and 
transaction somewhere else. There are two approaches for this.</p>
<h5>UnitOfWork attribute</h5>
<p>First and preferred approach is using <strong>UnitOfWorkAttribute</strong>. Example:</p>
<pre lang="cs">[UnitOfWork]
public void CreatePerson(CreatePersonInput input)
{
    var person = new Person { Name = input.Name, EmailAddress = input.EmailAddress };
    _personRepository.Insert(person);
    _statisticsRepository.IncrementPeopleCount();
}</pre>
<p>Thus, CreatePerson methods becomes unit of work and manages database 
connection and transaction, both repositories use same unit of work. Note that 
no need to UnitOfWork attribute if this is an application service method. See '<a href="#DocUowRestrictions">unit 
of work method restrictions</a>' section.</p>
<p>There are some options of the UnitOfWork attribute. See 'unit of work in 
detail' section.</p>
<h5>IUnitOfWorkManager</h5>
<p>Second appropaches is using the <strong>IUnitOfWorkManager.Begin(...)</strong> 
method as 
shown below:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class MyService
{
    private readonly IUnitOfWorkManager _unitOfWorkManager;
    private readonly IPersonRepository _personRepository;
    private readonly IStatisticsRepository _statisticsRepository;

    public MyService(IUnitOfWorkManager unitOfWorkManager, IPersonRepository personRepository, IStatisticsRepository statisticsRepository)
    {
        _unitOfWorkManager = unitOfWorkManager;
        _personRepository = personRepository;
        _statisticsRepository = statisticsRepository;
    }

    public void CreatePerson(CreatePersonInput input)
    {
        var person = new Person { Name = input.Name, EmailAddress = input.EmailAddress };

        using (var unitOfWork = _unitOfWorkManager.Begin())
        {
            _personRepository.Insert(person);
            _statisticsRepository.IncrementPeopleCount();

            unitOfWork.Complete();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>You can inject and use IUnitOfWorkManager as shown here (if you inherit your 
application service from ApplicationService class, then you can directly use
<strong>CurrentUnitOfWork</strong> 
property. If not, you should inject IUnitOfWorkManager). Thus, you can create more <strong>limited scope</strong> unit of works. In this approach, you 
should call <strong>Complete</strong> method manually. If you don't call, 
transaction is rolled back and changes are not saved.</p>
<p>Begin method has overloads 
to set <strong>unit of work options</strong>.</p>
<p>It's better and 
shorter to use <strong>UnitOfWork</strong> attribute if you don't have a good reason.</p>

<h3 id="DocUowDetails">Unit of work in detail</h3>
<h4 id="DocDisablingUow">Disabling unit of work</h4>
<p>You may want to disable unit of work for an <strong>application service method</strong> 
(since it's enabled as default). To do 
that, use UnitOfWorkAttribute's IsDisabled property. Example usage:</p>
<pre lang="cs">[UnitOfWork(IsDisabled = true)]
public virtual void RemoveFriendship(RemoveFriendshipInput input)
{
    _friendshipRepository.Delete(input.Id);
}
</pre>
<p>Normally, you don't want to do that since an application service method 
should be atomic and uses database in general. Some situations you may want to 
disable unit of work for an application service method:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your method does not perform any database operation at all and you don't 
	want to open an unnecessary database connection.</li>
	<li>You want to use unit of work in a limited scope with UnitOfWorkScope 
	class described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if a unit of work method calls this RemoveFriendship method, 
disabling is ignored and it uses the same unit of work with the caller method. 
So, use disabling by carefully. Also, the code above works well since repository 
methods are unit of work as default.</p>
<h4 id="DocUowNoTransaction">Non-transactional unit of work</h4>
<p>A unit of work is transactional as default (by it's nature). Thus, ASP.NET 
Boilerplate starts/commits/rollbacks an explicit database-level transaction. In 
some special cases, transaction may cause problems since it may lock some rows 
or tables in the database. In this situations, you may want to disable 
database-level transaction. UnitOfWork attribute can get a boolean value in it's 
constructor to work as non-transactional. Example usage:</p>
<pre lang="cs">[UnitOfWork(<span lang="tr">isTransactional: </span>false)]
public GetTasksOutput GetTasks(GetTasksInput input)
{
    var tasks = _taskRepository.GetAllWithPeople(input.AssignedPersonId, input.State);
    return new GetTasksOutput
            {
                Tasks = Mapper.Map&lt;List&lt;TaskDto&gt;&gt;(tasks)
            };
}</pre>
<p>I suggest to use this attribute as <strong>[UnitOfWork(isTransactional: false)]</strong>. 
I think it's more readable and explicit. But you can use as [UnitOfWork(false)].</p>
<p>Note that ORM frameworks (like NHibernate and EntityFramework) internally 
saves changes in a single command. Assume that you updated a few Entities in a 
non-transactional UOW. Even in this situation all updates are performed at end 
of the unit of work with a single database command. But if you execute an SQL 
query directly, it's performed immediately.</p>
<p>There is a restriction for non-transactional UOWs. If you're already in a 
transactional unit of work scope, setting isTransactional to false is ignored.</p>
<p>Use non-transactional unit of works carefully since most of the times it 
should be transactional for data integrity. If your method just reads data, not 
changes it, it can be non-transactional of course.</p>
<h4 id="DocUowCallsOtherMethod">A unit of work method calls another</h4>
<p>If a unit of work method (a method declared with UnitOfWork attribute) calls 
another unit of work method, they share same connection and transaction. First 
method manages connection, others use it. This true for methods run in same
<strong>Thread</strong> (or in same request for web applications). Actually, when a unit of work scope begins, all codes 
executing in same thread shares same connection and transaction until the unit of 
work scope ends. This is true both for UnitOfWork attribute and UnitOfWorkScope 
class.</p>
<h4>Unit of work scope</h4>
<p>You can create a different and isolated transaction in another transaction or 
can create a non-transactional scope in a transaction. .NET defines
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.transactions.transactionscopeoption(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">
TransactionScopeOption</a> for that. You can set Scope option of the unit of 
work. </p>
<h4 id="DocAutoSaveChanges">Automatically saving changes</h4>
<p>When we use unit of work for a method, ASP.NET Boilerplate saves 
all changes at the end of the method automatically. Assume that we need method to update name of a person:</p>
<pre lang="cs">[UnitOfWork]
public void UpdateName(UpdateNameInput input)
{
    var person = _personRepository.Get(input.PersonId);
    person.Name = input.NewName;
}</pre>
<p>That's all, name was changed! We did not even called _personRepository.Update 
method. O/RM framework keep track of all changes of entities in a unit of work 
and reflects changes to the database.</p>
<p>Note that no need to declare UnitOfWork for application service methods since 
they are unit of work as default.</p>
<h4 id="DocRepositoryGetAll">IRepository.GetAll() method</h4>
<p>When you call GetAll() out of a repository method, there must be an open database connection since it 
returns IQueryable. This is needed because of deferred execution of IQueryable<T>. It does not perform database query unless you call ToList() method or use the IQueryable<T> in a foreach loop (or somehow access to queried items). So, when you call ToList() method, database connection must be alive.</p>
<p>Consider the example below:</p>
<pre lang="cs">[UnitOfWork]
public SearchPeopleOutput SearchPeople(SearchPeopleInput input)
{
    //Get IQueryable&lt;Person&gt;
    var query = _personRepository.GetAll();

    //Add some filters if selected
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(input.SearchedName))
    {
        query = query.Where(person =&gt; person.Name.StartsWith(input.SearchedName));
    }

    if (input.IsActive.HasValue)
    {
        query = query.Where(person =&gt; person.IsActive == input.IsActive.Value);
    }

    //Get paged result list
    var people = query.Skip(input.SkipCount).Take(input.MaxResultCount).ToList();

    return new SearchPeopleOutput { People = Mapper.Map&lt;List&lt;PersonDto&gt;&gt;(people) };
}</pre>
<p>Here, SearchPeople method must be unit of work since ToList() method of IQueryable is 
called in the method body, and database connection must be open when 
IQueryable.ToList() is executed.</p>
<p>Like that for GetAll() method, you must use unit of work if a database 
connection is needed out of the repository. Note that application service 
methods are unit of work by default.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="DocUowRestrictions">UnitOfWork attribute restrictions</h4>
<p>You can use UnitOfWork attribute for;</p>
<ul>
	<li>All <strong>public</strong> or <strong>public virtual</strong> methods for classes 
	those are used over interface 
	(Like an application service used over service interface).</li>
	<li>All <strong>public virtual</strong> methods for self injected classes (Like
	<strong>MVC Controllers</strong> and <strong>Web API Controllers</strong>).</li>
	<li>All <strong>protected virtual</strong> methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's suggested to always make the method <strong>virtual</strong>.&nbsp;You can 
<strong>not use for private methods</strong>. 
Because, ASP.NET Boilerplate uses dynamic proxying for that and private methods 
can not be seen by derived classes. UnitOfWork attribute (and any proxying) does 
not work if you don't use <a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">
dependency injection</a> and instantiate the class yourself.</p>

<h3 id="DocUowOptions">Options</h3>
<p>There are some options can be used to change behaviour of a unit of work.</p>
<p>First, we can change default values of all unit of works in the
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Startup-Configuration">startup configuration</a>. This 
is generally done in PreInitialize method of our
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Module-System">module</a>.</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class SimpleTaskSystemCoreModule : AbpModule
{
    public override void PreInitialize()
    {
        Configuration.UnitOfWork.IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted;
        Configuration.UnitOfWork.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    }

    //...other module methods
}</pre>
<p>Second, we can override defaults for a particular unit of work. For that, <strong>
UnitOfWork </strong> attribute constructor and IUnitOfWorkManager.<strong>Begin</strong> 
method have overloads to get options.</p>
<h3 id="DocUowMethods">Methods</h3>
<p>UnitOfWork system works seamlessly and invisibly. But, in some special cases, 
you need to call it's methods.</p>
<h4 id="DocUowSaveChanges">SaveChanges</h4>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate saves all changes at end of a unit of work, you don't 
have to do anything. But, sometimes, you may want to save changes to database in 
middle of a unit of work operation. In this case, you can 
inject IUnitOfWorkManager and&nbsp;call IUnitOfWorkManager.Current.<strong>SaveChanges()</strong> method. An example 
usage may be saving changes to get Id of a new inserted
<a href="/Pages/Documents/Entities">Entity</a> in <a href="/Pages/Documents/EntityFramework-Integration">
EntityFramework</a>. Note that: if current unit of work is transactional, all 
changes in the transaction are rolled back if an exception occurs, even saved 
changes.</p>

<h3 id="DocEvents">Events</h3>
<p>A unit of work has <strong>Completed</strong>, <strong>Failed</strong> and <strong>Disposed</strong> events. 
You can register to these events and perform needed operations. Inject 
IUnitOfWorkManager and use IUnitOfWorkManager.Current property to get active 
unit of work and register to it's events.</p>
<p>You may want to run some code when current unit of work successfully 
completed. Example:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public void CreateTask(CreateTaskInput input)
{
    var task = new Task { Description = input.Description };

    if (input.AssignedPersonId.HasValue)
    {
        task.AssignedPersonId = input.AssignedPersonId.Value;

        _unitOfWorkManager.Current.Completed += (sender, args) =&gt; { /* TODO: Send email to assigned person */ };
    }

    _taskRepository.Insert(task);
}</pre>
