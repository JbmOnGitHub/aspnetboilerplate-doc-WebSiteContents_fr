<h3 id="DocIntro">Introduction</h3>
<p>Wikipedia: "<em>An audit trail (also called audit log) is a security-relevant chronological record, set of records, and/or destination and source of records that provide documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected at any time a specific operation, procedure, or even</em>".</p>
<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate provides an infrastructure to automatically log all 
interactions with the application. It can record intended method calls with 
caller info and arguments. </p>
<p>Basically, saved fields are: Related <strong>tenant id</strong>, caller
<strong>user id</strong>, called <strong>service name</strong> (the class of the 
called method), called <strong>method name</strong>, execution <strong>
parameters</strong> (serialized into JSON), <strong>execution time</strong>, 
execution <strong>duration</strong> (as milliseconds), client <strong>IP address</strong>, 
client's <strong>computer name</strong> and the <strong>exception</strong> (if 
method throws an exception).</p>
<p>Wtih these informations, we not just know who did the operation, also can 
measure <strong>performance</strong> of the application and observe <strong>exceptions</strong> thrown. 
Even more, you can get <strong>statistics</strong> about usage of your 
application.</p>
<p>Auditing system uses <a href="/Pages/Documents/Abp-Session"><strong>
IAbpSession</strong></a> to get current UserId and TenantId.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<h4>About IAuditingStore</h4>
	<p><span class="auto-style1">Auditing system uses IAuditingStore</span> to 
	save audit informatins. While you can 
	implement it in your own way, it's fully implemented in <strong>module-zero</strong> 
	project. If you don't implement it, SimpleLogAuditingStore is used and it 
	writes audit informations to the <a href="/Pages/Documents/Logging">log</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="DocConfig">Configuration</h3>
<p>To configure auditing, you can use <strong>Configuration.Auditing</strong> 
property in your <a href="/Pages/Documents/Module-System">module</a>'s 
PreInitialize method. Auditing is <strong>enabled by default</strong>. You can 
disable it as shown below.</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class MyModule : AbpModule
{
    public override void PreInitialize()
    {
        Configuration.Auditing.IsEnabled = false;
    }

    //...
}</pre>
<p>Here, a list of auditing configuration properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>IsEnabled</strong>: Used to enable/disable auditing system 
	completely. Default: <strong>true</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>IsEnabledForAnonymousUsers</strong>: If this is set to true, 
	audit logs are saved also for users those are not logged in to the system. 
	Default: <strong>false</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>MvcControllers</strong>: Used to configure auditing for ASP.NET MVC Controllers.<ul>
		<li><strong>IsEnabled</strong>: Used to enable/disable auditing for MVC controllers. 
		Default: <strong>true</strong>.</li>
		<li><strong>IsEnabledForChildActions</strong>: Used to enable/disable auditing for child MVC actions. 
		Default: <strong>false</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Selectors</strong>: Used to select other classes to save audit logs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see, auditing for <strong>MVC</strong> controller are seperately 
configured since a different technique is used for it.</p>
<p><strong>Selectors</strong> is a list of predicates to select other types to 
save audit logs. A selector has a unique <strong>name </strong>and a <strong>
predicate</strong>. The only <strong>default</strong> selector in this list is used to select
<strong>application service classes</strong>. It's defined as shown below:</p>
<pre lang="cs">Configuration.Auditing.Selectors.Add(
    new NamedTypeSelector(
        "Abp.ApplicationServices",
        type =&gt; typeof (IApplicationService).IsAssignableFrom(type)
    )
);</pre>
<p>You can add your selectors in your module's PreInitialize method. Also, you 
can remove the selector above by name if you don't like to save audit logs for 
application services. That's why it has a unique name (Use simple LINQ to find 
the selector in Selectors and remove it if you want).</p>

<h3 id="DocEnableDisableByAttrs">Enable/Disable by attributes</h3>
<p>While you can select auditing classes by configuration, you can use <strong>
Audited</strong> and <strong>DisableAuditing</strong> attributes for a single 
class or a single method. An example:</p>
<pre lang="cs">[Audited]
public class MyClass
{
    public void MyMethod1(int a)
    {
        //...
    }

    [DisableAuditing]
    public void MyMethod2(string b)
    {
        //...
    }

    public void MyMethod3(int a, int b)
    {
        //...
    }
}</pre>
<p>All methods of MyClass are audited except MyMethod2 since it's explicitly 
disabled. Audited attribute can be used for a method to just save audits for the 
desired method.</p>
<h3 id="DocNotes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A method must be <strong>public </strong>in order to saving audit logs. 
	Private and protected methods are ignored.</li>
	<li>A method must be <strong>virtual </strong>if it's called over class 
	reference. This is not needed if it's injected using it's interface (like 
	injecting IPersonService interface to use PersonService class). This is 
	needed since ASP.NET Boilerplate uses dynamic proxying and interception. 
	This is not true for <strong>MVC </strong>Controller actions. They may not 
	be virtual.</li>
</ul>
